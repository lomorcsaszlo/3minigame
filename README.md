**Irányítás**
Kattints a jobb oldali oszlopban felsorolt színű golyóra, hogy beírd azt. Négy színt kell kitalálnod. Fekete golyó az színkombináció mellett: a szín helyesen lett kitalálva, és a megfelelő helyre került. Fehér golyó a színkombináció mellett: a szín helyesen lett kitalálva, de nem került a megfelelő helyre.
